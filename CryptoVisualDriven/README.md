**Backgound:**

Crypto has seen some of its best days and worst days. In very recent times there has been some confusion in the space. We need a tool that can allow us to learn about certain coins and their characteristics to determine if we want to buy or sell those coins.

**Solution:**

A python set of processes that can fetch relevant trading information, display as output an image on the trends seen in the input coin selections, and arrange this data for both analysis and storage.

We created 5 functions totally. 1st function to download data according to cryptocoin input and save the data to csv. Then there are 3 functions for price visualisation, including general close_price graphic, 1 short term candlestick, 1 long term candlestick. And last function is created to compare 2 cryptocoin.
